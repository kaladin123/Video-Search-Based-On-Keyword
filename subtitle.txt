Welcome to this course
on Advanced TensorFlow. Over the next few weeks, you will explore scenarios
where you can go beyond basic Keras layer definition
for the creation of ML models by exploring
custom loss functions, callbacks, layers and models. But to begin it all off, you'll look at a new way
of coding your layers. It's called the functional API and you can see it
in the next video.
